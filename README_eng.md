**# The Project Overview**

The project aims to develop a system for hydrological analysis and forecasting based on meteorological and hydrological data from the open data repository of the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management â€“ National Research Institute (IMGW-PIB). The system is designed to support the analysis of hydrological and meteorological phenomena, such as water levels, precipitation, and river flows, taking into account the geographical variability across Poland

In order to prevent issues with the source code and data, the project has been deployed to the Streamlit cloud service. The app is available at the following address: https://hydrological-analysis-system-app.streamlit.app/
